description: The object of this book is to suggest certain lines of thought as to
  the deep truths underlying Christianity, truths generally overlooked, and only too
  often denied. The generous wish to share with all what is precious, to spread broadcast
  priceless truths, to shut out none from the illumination of true knowledge, has
  resulted in a zeal without discretion that has vulgarised Christianity, and has
  presented its teachings in a form that often repels the heart and alienates the
  intellect. The command to "preach the Gospel to every creature"?though admittedly
  of doubtful authenticity?has.
